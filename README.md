## INTRODUCTION
This is a project on the analysis of nutrition related data from college students. I chose this dataset because it was messy and I wanted to practice my data cleaning and analysis skills using Excel. It contains both open ended and closed questions however my analysis focused on answering the questions under the problem statement.


## PROBLEM STATEMENT
1. Does frequency of cooking while at school have an impact on one’s GPA?
2. What kind of food do those who perceive themselves to be slim/fit/just right in terms of their body size consume?
3. Is having a low score for if life is rewarding associated with consumption of unhealthy food?
4. Does parental level of education have an impact on their children’s choice of diet later in life?
5. Is there an association between the choice of food and year of study?
6. Does marital status influence the choice of food?
  

## DATA SOURCING
I obtained this dataset from kaggle. It contains 126 responses from Mercyhurst University students concerning their food choices and nutrition.


## SKILLS DEMONSTRATED
* Data cleaning
* Data analysis
* Data visualisation


## DATA CLEANING 
* Changed the data types for the GPA and other columns having numerical data from general to numerical.
* Using the replace function, I replaced majority of codes in the dataset with the original responses particularly for those with closed ended responses.
* Four rows under the GPA column were blank so they were replaced with the average of the other rows (3.40).
* Removal of null values using (windows+f5+ enter), special, blank then ctrl minus.

 
## DATA ANALYSIS, VISUALISATION AND CONCLUSIONS
1. Those who cook a couple of times a week and whenever they can are responsible for the highest gpa. Those who cook only during holidays and whenever they can are responsible for the lowest gpa. Those who cooked every day, only during holidays and those who never cook have a lower inter quartile range  compared to the other two categories but considering the fact that those who cook everyday have more students scoring above the average gpa of 3.4,cooking everyday could be associated with having a higher gpa.

3.	Most of the respondents had the perception that their body size was just right. Those who thought they were overweight, slightly overweight or slim considered the type of food they consumed to be unhealthy while those who considered themselves to be fit/just right did the opposite. Reasons for consuming unhealthy food could include “inability to gain weight by slim people, fulfilling cravings and their availability among others.

4.	The respondents were asked to rate the statement ‘I find my life fulfilling’ with 1 being the least and 10 being the most. Majority gave a rating of 1 and of these, most perceived their choice of food to be unhealthy. Majority gave a rating below 5 and perceived their choice of food to be unhealthy.

5.	On parental education;
          1 - less than high school 
          2 - high school degree 
          3 - some college degree 
          4 - college degree 
          5 - graduate degree 
Generally, regardless of the level of education, majority of the respondents reported that their choice of food was unhealthy. With majority of the parents having a minimum of a college degree, their children reported to having an unhealthy diet. It is therefore difficult to create an association between parental level of education and their children’s choice of food late in life.

7. Except sophomores, all other study years reported to having consumed an unhealthy diet. Respondents in their senior year consumed more unhealthy food than their juniors. There is no clear association between the type of food consumed and the study year in this data set.
8. Majority of those dating reported that they consumed healthy food unlike their single counterparts or those who reported to have consumed the same food over and over again.
