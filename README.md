# UNIVERSITY STUDENTS' DIETARY CHOICES
![
## INTRODUCTION
This is a project on the analysis of nutrition related data from college students. I chose this dataset because it was messy and I wanted to practice my data cleaning and analysis skills using Excel. It contains both open ended and closed questions however my analysis focused on answering the questions under the problem statement.


## PROBLEM STATEMENT
1. Does frequency of cooking while at school have an impact on one’s GPA?
2. What kind of food do those who perceive themselves to be slim/fit/just right in terms of their body size consume?
3. Is having a low score for if life is rewarding associated with consumption of unhealthy food?
4. Does parental level of education have an impact on their children’s choice of diet later in life?
5. Is there an association between the choice of food and year of study?
6. Does marital status influence the choice of food?
  

## DATA SOURCING
I obtained this dataset from kaggle. It contains 126 responses from Mercyhurst University students concerning their food choices and nutrition.


## SKILLS DEMONSTRATED
* Data cleaning
* Data analysis
* Data visualisation


## DATA CLEANING 
* Changed the data types for the GPA and other columns having numerical data from general to numerical.
* Using the replace function, I replaced majority of codes in the dataset with the original responses particularly for those with closed ended responses.
* Four rows under the GPA column were blank so they were replaced with the average of the other rows (3.40).
* Removal of null values using (windows+f5+ enter), special, blank then ctrl minus.
